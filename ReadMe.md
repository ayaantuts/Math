# Welcome to the repository
## This is a repository for my math notes I've learnt at [Dwarkadas J. Sanghvi College of Engineering](https://www.djsce.ac.in/)

I've typed my notes in the form of markdown files.
They are divided into branches according to the semester.

## How to read the formulae?
If you are using a computer, you can use the following steps to read the formulae:

1. First, we need to set a zoom trigger. This could be done only once.
	1. Right-click on one of the formulae.
	1. Click on `Math setting`.
	1. Click on `Zoom Trigger`.
	1. Click on `Click`. (or any other option you want)
	1. *(Optional)* Click on `Zoom Factor` and set the zoom factor. (preferably 150%)

1. Now, to zoom in on a formula, click on it (or the trigger you set).

1. To zoom out, click anywhere on the page.

If you are using a mobile phone, you can use the pinch gesture to zoom in and out. 

**Or you can follow the steps above, remember:- tap and long hold is equivalent to right click**
